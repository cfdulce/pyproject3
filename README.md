<h4> Python Project</h4>
**EGGSCRAMBLE** Unscramble Game.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Project details</h4>
The user is given a set of scrambled words that they must unscramble to complete the game. The game’s beginning starts with a story, later the user is asked to input their name and whether they would like to play. There will be 10 questions; however, if the user needs a hint, they may call the command and can get up to three hints per question (with the exception of a few question, there'll be some that don't have any available hints). Each question will have a designated number of points. The user will have to calculate the total points at the end of the game and input the amount to receive a “reward.”

 <p>**NOTE: I ran into an issue here... it say's that "break" is out of the loop. I'm not sure why that's showing up. If someone could explain why I'd really appreciate it!</p>
